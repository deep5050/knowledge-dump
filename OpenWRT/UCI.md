## üõ†Ô∏è Overview of UCI

### üìú What is UCI?
UCI is a configuration management system used in OpenWrt to provide a unified way to manage system settings across various services and applications. It abstracts the underlying configuration files, allowing users to interact with them through a consistent command-line interface.

### üóÇÔ∏è Configuration Structure
UCI organizes configuration data into a hierarchical structure consisting of:

- **Sections**: Each configuration file is divided into sections, which represent different components or services (e.g., network, wireless).
- **Options**: Each section contains options that define specific settings for that component.

#### Example Structure
A typical UCI configuration might look like this:

```
config interface 'lan'
    option ifname 'eth0'
    option proto 'static'
    option ipaddr '192.168.1.1'
    option netmask '255.255.255.0'
```

### üìÅ Configuration Files
UCI manages various configuration files located in `/etc/config/`. Each file corresponds to a specific service or component, such as:

- **network**: Network interface configurations.
- **wireless**: Wireless settings.
- **firewall**: Firewall rules and settings.
- **system**: General system settings.

### üõ†Ô∏è UCI Commands
UCI provides a set of commands to interact with the configuration system. Here are some common commands:

- **Get a Value**: Retrieve the value of a specific option.
  ```bash
  uci get <config>.<section>.<option>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  uci get network.lan.ipaddr
  ```

- **Set a Value**: Change the value of a specific option.
  ```bash
  uci set <config>.<section>.<option>='<value>'
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  uci set network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.1.2'
  ```

- **Delete an Option**: Remove an option from a section.
  ```bash
  uci delete <config>.<section>.<option>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  uci delete network.lan.netmask
  ```

- **Commit Changes**: Save changes made to the configuration.
  ```bash
  uci commit <config>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  uci commit network
  ```

- **Show All Configurations**: Display all configurations for a specific file.
  ```bash
  uci show <config>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  uci show network
  ```

### üîÑ Practical Usage
1. **Network Configuration**: UCI is commonly used to configure network interfaces. For example, to set up a static IP for the LAN interface:
   ```bash
   uci set network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.1.1'
   uci set network.lan.netmask='255.255.255.0'
   uci commit network
   ```

2. **Wireless Configuration**: To configure wireless settings, you can use UCI commands to set the SSID and encryption:
   ```bash
   uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].ssid='MyNetwork'
   uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].encryption='psk2'
   uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].key='mypassword'
   uci commit wireless
   ```

3. **Firewall Rules**: UCI can also manage firewall settings. For example, to allow SSH access:
   ```bash
   uci add firewall rule
   uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src='wan'
   uci set firewall.@rule[-1].target='ACCEPT'
   uci set firewall.@rule[-1].proto='tcp'
   uci set firewall.@rule[-1].dest_port='22'
   uci commit firewall
   ```

### üìö Conclusion
UCI is a powerful tool for managing configurations in OpenWrt, providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for both command-line and script-based management. Understanding UCI is essential for effectively configuring and maintaining OpenWrt devices. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
