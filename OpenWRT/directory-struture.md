## A tree-like structure representing the typical directory layout of the OpenWrt codebase:

```
openwrt/                  # Root of the OpenWrt source code
├── build_dir/           # Directory for building packages
├── feeds/               # Package feeds
│   ├── packages/        # Main package repository
│   ├── luci/            # LuCI web interface packages
│   └── routing/         # Routing-related packages
├── include/             # Header files and build configurations
├── package/             # Package definitions
│   ├── base-files/      # Base system files
│   ├── network/         # Network-related packages
│   ├── system/          # System-related packages
│   └── ...              # Other package categories
├── target/              # Target architecture-specific files
│   ├── linux/           # Linux kernel configurations
│   ├── ramips/          # RAMIPS target files
│   └── ...              # Other target architectures
├── tools/               # Build tools and scripts
├── .config              # Configuration file for the build system
├── Makefile             # Main Makefile for building OpenWrt
└── README.md            # Documentation and project information
```

### Key Directories Explained

- **`build_dir/`**: Contains the intermediate files generated during the build process.
- **`feeds/`**: Holds the package feeds, which are repositories of additional software packages.
- **`include/`**: Contains header files and build configurations used across the codebase.
- **`package/`**: This directory includes the definitions for various packages, organized by category.
- **`target/`**: Contains architecture-specific files, including kernel configurations and device support.
- **`tools/`**: Includes various tools and scripts used in the build process.
- **`.config`**: A configuration file that specifies the options selected for the build.
- **`Makefile`**: The main Makefile that orchestrates the build process for OpenWrt.
