AV over IP stands for “Audio-Visual over Internet Protocol”. Essentially, it is the transmission of audio-visual data over a network such as a LAN, WAN, or the internet. As opposed to traditional AV environments, AV over IP (also known as AV/IP or AVoIP) refers to the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">use of standard network equipment to transmit and switch video and audio</mark>. 

The concept of “Video over IP” has existed a long time. It encompasses everything from internet-based live or on-demand video streaming, to professional video distribution infrastructures in production and broadcast studios. What is being discussed in the professional AV (facilities AV) space over the last few years is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gradual replacement of traditional AV infrastructures with IP-based infrastructures</mark>—hence the term AV over IP. 

## Current/Traditional AV Technologies
[AV over IP vs The Matrix Switch: Comparing SDVoE to HDBaseT - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYp93z3TcYo)

Many AV products and services are designed to preserve maximum image and/or sound quality while the sources are being moved and switched. Other performance elements include fast switching and low latency throughout the pipeline. Additionally, some AV equipment is capable of performing processing operations such as multiplying the sources and making them simultaneously available in more than one place for consumption. 

More advanced processing involves performing modifications to the sources in real time. This can include changing the video signal from one type to another (like DisplayPort to HDMI), cropping, up- or down-scaling (for example changing from HD to 4K or 4K to HD), compositing (text overlays or combining multiple videos), and more. 

Everything described above for traditional AV is preserved when implementing AV over IP. The only difference is that the video and audio moving through the series of boxes and cables <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">changes from circuit-based to packet-based</mark>—like computer data networks and telephone over IP. Basically, Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules governing the format of data sent over the internet or other video and audio networks. AV-over-IP technology organizes the audio-visual data so that it conforms to those rules. Data transmitted over IP is subdivided into packets. Each packet contains part of the original file as well as additional control information such as source, destination, and sequence. 

## Similarities Between Traditional AV and AV over IP Setups

At the base, the elements in AV environments stay the same. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Traditional AV infrastructures are mainly concerned with the extension and switching of audio and video assets</mark>. The goal of an AV facility is to provide users the ability to see and/or hear their video and sound sources on their viewing stations and on their sound systems or speakers. To do this, sources need to be captured, moved, switched, and displayed. The user interface to change sources can be push buttons on hardware equipment, all the way to digital interfaces on computer-based technologies.

## Differences Between Traditional AV and AV over IP

AV over IP differs from traditional AV by evolving the following key aspects: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">scalable switching (many more ports and easier to add just what you need)</mark>, breaking the barriers of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">distance</mark>, improved ratio of inputs to outputs, video standards that extend beyond the local facility, convergence with data and communications, and new options in video processing.

### In Short

1. **Transmission Medium:**
   - Traditional AV: In traditional AV setups, audio and video signals are transmitted over dedicated hardware connections, such as HDMI, VGA, SDI (Serial Digital Interface), or component cables.
   - AV over IP: AV over IP leverages standard IP networks, such as Ethernet, to transmit audio and video signals. It encapsulates AV data into data packets, which are then sent over the network to the destination.

2. **Cabling and Infrastructure:**
   - Traditional AV: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Requires specific types of cables and connectors, often resulting in a more complex and dedicated cabling infrastructure. Long cable runs may require signal boosters or repeaters.</mark>
   - AV over IP:<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Utilizes standard network cabling (e.g., Cat 5e, Cat 6, or optical fiber) commonly used in IT environments, making it easier to integrate with existing network infrastructur</mark>e. This can reduce installation costs and simplify cabling management.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Traditional AV: Scalability can be<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> limited due to the need for specialized hardware connections and the length limitations of traditional AV cables</mark>.
   - AV over IP: Offers greater scalability as it leverages the inherent scalability of IP networks. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It allows easy expansion by adding more network switches and devices.</mark>

1. **Distance:**
   - Traditional AV:<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> Cabling limitations can restrict the distance</mark> over which audio and video signals can be transmitted without degradation.
   - AV over IP: Can support long-distance transmission over standard network cabling, making it suitable for larger venues or distributed AV systems.

5. **System Configuration and Management:**
   - Traditional AV: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Requires manual configuration of physical connections</mark>, which can be time-consuming, especially in complex setups.
   - AV over IP: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Offers centralized configuration and management through software-based controllers</mark>, allowing for easier monitoring, control, and changes to the AV system.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptability:**
   - Traditional AV: Typically designed for fixed installations, making it less adaptable to changes in system requirements or network configurations.
   - AV over IP: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Provides more flexibility and adaptability, allowing for dynamic changes and reconfiguration of AV streams without the need for physical rewiring.</mark>

7. **Cost:**
   - Traditional AV: In some cases, traditional AV equipment may be less expensive on a per-unit basis.
   - AV over IP: While AV over IP may have higher initial setup costs, it can be more cost-effective for larger installations, especially when utilizing existing network infrastructure.

### Main key points

#### Switching Ports
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The main advantage with AVoIP is more input/output options.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hardwired, circuit-based switching is basically a point-to-point technology</mark>. All the I/O combinations of transmitters to receivers are resolved inside the matrix switch and it is possible to use any source at any destination <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">according to the number of ports available on the video matrix switch</mark>. For example, an 8x8 matrix switch allows eight sources to be used at any of eight destinations. 

What’s different about IP (and packet-based switching) is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">number of sources attached to the IP switch is no longer as limited</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When physical ports run out, multiple IP switches can be connected to expand</mark>. What this means is that you can scale the number of ports to your needs much more conveniently. It is possible to keep adding sources and destinations without a substantial overhaul of the video matrix switcher centerpiece being a major limiting factor. 

The ratio of inputs to outputs can also be far more tailored in AV over IP compared to the traditional hardwired video matrix switcher. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It is possible to have MANY inputs but only a few outputs, or only a few inputs but MANY outputs</mark>. Or you can have MANY of both and in widely different quantities.

#### **Distance**

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">All hardwired digital transmissions have a practical limit to distance.</mark> Short distances of only a few feet can be wired cheaply. Once you’re at several meters, the cost of extension cables goes up. And when wires are being run throughout facilities over hundreds of meters, the cost of installation and extension becomes higher still. 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">IP based AV Can support long-distance transmission over standard network cabling</mark>, making it suitable for larger venues or distributed AV systems.

## Challenges with AVoIP
