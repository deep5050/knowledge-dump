# Network operating system (NOS)
#network #switch

A Network Operating System (NOS) is a specialized <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">software that facilitates the management and coordination of network resources in a computer network</mark>. It is designed to provide essential networking functionalities and services to enable communication and data sharing among multiple devices, such as computers, servers, printers, and other network-enabled devices.

The key features and functions of a Network Operating System typically include:

1. Network Resource Management: NOS allows administrators to control and manage network resources, such as file servers, printers, and storage devices. It provides a centralized platform to allocate and monitor these resources efficiently.

2. User Authentication and Access Control:<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> NOS includes mechanisms for user authentication and access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific network resources and data.</mark>

3. File and Print Services: NOS enables file sharing and printing services across the network, allowing users to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">access shared files and print documents on network-connected printers.</mark>

4. Network Security: NOS incorporates security features like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">protect the network from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.</mark>

5. Network Communication Protocols: It supports various networking protocols that facilitate data transmission and communication between devices on the network. Examples include TCP/IP, UDP, and DHCP.

6. Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: NOS provides tools and utilities for network administrators to monitor network performance, identify issues, and troubleshoot problems effectively.

7. Scalability and Redundancy: A good NOS should be scalable to support expanding network infrastructures and offer redundancy to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Examples of network operating systems include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Microsoft Windows Server, Linux-based distributions like Ubuntu Server,</mark> Novell NetWare (though less common today), and other specialized network operating systems designed for specific networking hardware or industries.

## Deployment

Network Operating Systems (NOS) can be deployed on a wide range of network hardware, as long as the hardware meets the minimum system requirements specified by the NOS vendor. Some common network hardware on which NOS can be deployed include:

1. Servers:<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> NOS is typically deployed on dedicated server hardware</mark>. These servers can be rack-mounted or in tower form factors and are designed to handle the processing and storage requirements of a network. Examples include Dell PowerEdge, HP ProLiant, and Lenovo ThinkSystem servers.

2. Network-Attached Storage (NAS) Devices: Some NOS solutions are specifically designed to run on NAS devices. These devices are dedicated storage units that connect directly to the network, providing centralized storage and file sharing capabilities. Examples include devices from Synology, QNAP, and Buffalo.

3. Network Switches and Routers: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">While switches and routers themselves are not the primary platforms for deploying NOS, they play a critical role in routing data between devices and enabling network connectivity. NOS can be integrated into these devices to provide additional management and control functionalities.</mark>

4. Virtual Machines (VMs):<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> NOS can be deployed as virtual machines on virtualization platforms such as VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, or KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).</mark> Virtualization allows multiple NOS instances to run on a single physical server, increasing flexibility and resource utilization.

5. Network Appliances: Some NOS solutions come pre-installed on specialized network appliances designed for specific purposes, such as firewall appliances, content filtering appliances, or load balancers.

6. Embedded Systems: In certain scenarios, NOS can be deployed on embedded systems, which are specialized hardware devices with integrated software and limited resources. These are commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart home systems, and other small-scale networking applications.

The choice of network hardware for deploying NOS depends on the organization's specific needs, the scale of the network, the required performance, and the budget. When selecting NOS and the associated hardware, it's essential to consider factors like the number of users, the volume of network traffic, the types of services required, and the level of security needed.


## Summary of SONiC, OpenSwitch & OVS

SONiC, OpenSwitch, and Open vSwitch (OVS) are all open-source network software projects that fall under the umbrella of Network Operating Systems (NOS) or network-related technologies. Each of them serves a specific purpose in the realm of network management and virtualization:

1. SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud):
SONiC is an open-source NOS developed by Microsoft and contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP). <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It is designed for cloud-scale data centers and provides a flexible and modular platform for managing network switches.</mark> SONiC is hardware-agnostic, meaning it can run on a wide range of white-box switches, which are switches built on standard, off-the-shelf hardware components. The goal of SONiC is to offer a fully open, programmable, and scalable network infrastructure for cloud providers and large data center operators.

2. OpenSwitch:
OpenSwitch is an open-source, Linux-based NOS that focuses on providing a network operating system for enterprise-grade network switches. It was initially launched by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and later became a Linux Foundation project.<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> OpenSwitch aims to create a vendor-neutral and customizable NOS for data center and campus network switches.</mark> Like SONiC, it can run on white-box hardware, offering greater flexibility and choice for network deployments.

3. Open vSwitch (OVS):
Open vSwitch (OVS) is a different kind of open-source project than the previous two. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It is a virtual switch rather than a complete NOS</mark>. OVS is designed for virtualized environments and allows network administrators to create and manage virtual networks within virtualized infrastructures like VMware, KVM, Xen, and others. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It provides a flexible and programmable virtual switch that can be integrated into various virtualization platforms, offering advanced features like flow control, VLAN tagging, and tunneling protocols for interconnecting virtual machines (VMs) and physical networks.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In summary, SONiC and OpenSwitch are complete NOS projects designed for physical network switches, while Open vSwitch is a virtual switch targeted at virtualized environments.</mark> Each project contributes to the open-source networking ecosystem, providing options for network administrators and developers to build scalable, programmable, and efficient network infrastructures.
