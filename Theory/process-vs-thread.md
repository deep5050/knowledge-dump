## A comprehensive comparison between processes and threads, highlighting their key differences:

| **Aspect**                | **Process**                                         | **Thread**                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A process is an independent program in execution, containing its own memory space. | A thread is a smaller unit of a process that can run concurrently, sharing the same memory space. |
| **Memory Allocation**     | Each process has its own memory space, including code, data, and stack segments. | Threads share the same memory space of the process, including global variables and heap memory. |
| **Creation Overhead**     | Creating a new process is more resource-intensive and slower due to memory allocation and setup. | Creating a new thread is faster and requires less overhead since it shares the process's resources. |
| **Communication**         | Inter-process communication (IPC) is required for processes to communicate, which can be complex and slower. | Threads can communicate easily and quickly through shared memory, as they belong to the same process. |
| **Isolation**             | Processes are isolated from each other; a crash in one process does not affect others. | Threads are not isolated; a crash in one thread can affect the entire process. |
| **Resource Sharing**      | Processes do not share resources directly; they require IPC mechanisms. | Threads share resources like memory and file descriptors, making resource sharing easier. |
| **Execution**             | Processes have their own execution context, including program counter and registers. | Threads have their own execution context but share the same program counter and registers of the process. |
| **Scheduling**            | The operating system schedules processes independently. | Threads within the same process can be scheduled independently, allowing for more efficient CPU utilization. |
| **Use Cases**             | Suitable for applications requiring isolation, such as running different applications. | Ideal for tasks that require concurrent execution, such as web servers or applications with multiple tasks. |
| **Overhead**              | Higher overhead due to separate memory management and context switching. | Lower overhead since threads share the same memory and resources. |

This table summarizes the fundamental differences between processes and threads, illustrating how they operate within a system and their respective advantages and disadvantages.
