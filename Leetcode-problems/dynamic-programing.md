Dynamic programming is a method used in computer science and mathematics to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed efficiently from solutions to smaller subproblems.

## Key Concepts of Dynamic Programming

### 1. **Optimal Substructure**
This means that the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. If a problem exhibits this property, it can often be solved using dynamic programming.

### 2. **Overlapping Subproblems**
Dynamic programming is **applicable when the problem can be broken down into subproblems that are reused multiple times**. Instead of solving the same subproblem repeatedly, dynamic programming solves each subproblem once and stores its result, which can be reused later.

### 3. **Memoization vs. Tabulation**
- **Memoization**: This is a top-down approach where you solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems in a table (usually an array or a dictionary) to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Tabulation**: This is a bottom-up approach where you solve all possible subproblems first and store their results in a table, building up to the solution of the original problem.

### 4. **Applications**
Dynamic programming is widely used in various fields, including:
- **Algorithm Design**: Problems like the Fibonacci sequence, shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra's), and the Knapsack problem.
- **Operations Research**: Resource allocation and scheduling problems.
- **Bioinformatics**: Sequence alignment and DNA sequencing.

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can significantly reduce the time complexity of algorithms, making it a fundamental concept in computer science.

### Examples

Here are some common LeetCode problems that utilize dynamic programming:
