## Problem Description: LeetCode 209 - Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

### Example:
- Input: `target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`
- Output: `2` (The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.)

- Input: `target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]`
- Output: `1` (The subarray `[4]` has the minimal length.)

- Input: `target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`
- Output: `0` (No subarray meets the requirement.)

### Constraints:
- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^10`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## C++ Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
    int left = 0; // Left pointer for the sliding window
    int sum = 0; // Current sum of the window
    int minLength = INT_MAX; // Initialize minimum length to maximum integer value

    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
        sum += nums[right]; // Add the current number to the sum

        // While the current sum is greater than or equal to the target
        while (sum >= target) {
            minLength = min(minLength, right - left + 1); // Update the minimum length
            sum -= nums[left]; // Remove the leftmost number from the sum
            left++; // Move the left pointer to the right
        }
    }

    return (minLength == INT_MAX) ? 0 : minLength; // Return 0 if no valid subarray was found
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3};
    int target = 7;
    int result = minSubArrayLen(target, nums);

    cout << "Minimum length of subarray: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We traverse the array once with the right pointer and potentially move the left pointer multiple times, but each element is processed at most twice.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)**. We use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and variables used to track the sum and minimum length.

## Key Concepts and Tricks

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This problem is efficiently solved using the sliding window technique. By maintaining a window defined by two pointers (left and right), we can dynamically adjust the size of the window based on the current sum.

2. **Dynamic Sum Calculation**: As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we continuously add to the sum. When the sum meets or exceeds the target, we attempt to shrink the window from the left to find the minimal length.

3. **Early Exit**: If we find a valid subarray, we update the minimum length and continue to check if we can find a smaller valid subarray by moving the left pointer.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The algorithm returns `0` if no valid subarray is found, which is handled by checking if `minLength` remains at its initialized value.

This approach is optimal for solving the Minimum Size Subarray Sum problem, ensuring that we can determine the result in linear time with minimal space usage.
