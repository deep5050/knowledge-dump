## Problem Statement

The **Isomorphic Strings** problem on LeetCode asks whether two given strings, `s` and `t`, are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, and a character cannot map to itself.

### Example:
- Input: `s = "egg"`, `t = "add"`
- Output: `true`

- Input: `s = "foo"`, `t = "bar"`
- Output: `false`

## C++ Solution

Hereâ€™s a C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

bool isIsomorphic(std::string s, std::string t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

    std::unordered_map<char, char> mapST;
    std::unordered_map<char, char> mapTS;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        char charS = s[i];
        char charT = t[i];

        // Check mapping from s to t
        if (mapST.find(charS) == mapST.end()) {
            mapST[charS] = charT;
        } else if (mapST[charS] != charT) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check mapping from t to s
        if (mapTS.find(charT) == mapTS.end()) {
            mapTS[charT] = charS;
        } else if (mapTS[charT] != charS) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "egg";
    std::string t = "add";
    std::cout << (isIsomorphic(s, t) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    s = "foo";
    t = "bar";
    std::cout << (isIsomorphic(s, t) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we traverse both strings once, performing constant-time operations for each character.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)** in terms of the number of unique characters, but in the worst case, it can be considered **O(n)** if all characters are unique and stored in the hash maps.

## Key Tricks/Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Character Mapping**: Use two hash maps to maintain the mapping of characters from `s` to `t` and from `t` to `s`. This ensures that the mapping is consistent in both directions.

2. **Length Check**: Before proceeding with the mapping, check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, they cannot be isomorphic.

3. **Iterate Through Characters**: Loop through each character of the strings and check:
   - If the character from `s` has been mapped to a character in `t`. If it has, ensure it maps to the same character.
   - Similarly, check the reverse mapping from `t` to `s`.

4. **Return Result**: If all characters are successfully mapped without conflicts, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

By following these steps, you can efficiently determine if two strings are isomorphic.
