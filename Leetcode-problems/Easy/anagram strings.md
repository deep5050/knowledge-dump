## Problem Statement

The **Anagram** problem asks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequency, but possibly in a different order. 

### Example:
- Input: `s1 = "anagram"`, `s2 = "nagaram"`
- Output: `true`

- Input: `s1 = "rat"`, `s2 = "car"`
- Output: `false`

## C++ Solution

Hereâ€™s a C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

bool isAnagram(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
    // If the lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;

    std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;

    // Count the frequency of each character in s1
    for (char c : s1) {
        charCount[c]++;
    }

    // Decrease the frequency based on characters in s2
    for (char c : s2) {
        if (charCount.find(c) == charCount.end() || charCount[c] == 0) {
            return false; // Character not found or frequency mismatch
        }
        charCount[c]--;
    }

    return true; // All characters matched
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "anagram";
    std::string s2 = "nagaram";
    std::cout << (isAnagram(s1, s2) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    s1 = "rat";
    s2 = "car";
    std::cout << (isAnagram(s1, s2) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we traverse each string once to count characters and then again to check for matches.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)** in terms of the number of unique characters, but it can be considered **O(k)** where `k` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters). In the worst case, if all characters are unique, it can be **O(n)**.

## Key Tricks/Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Length Check**: Start by checking if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, they cannot be anagrams.

2. **Character Frequency Count**: Use a hash map (or an array if the character set is limited) to count the frequency of each character in the first string.

3. **Frequency Comparison**: Iterate through the second string, decrementing the count for each character found. If a character is not found or its count goes below zero, return `false`.

4. **Final Check**: If all characters are matched correctly, return `true`.

By following these steps, you can efficiently determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.
