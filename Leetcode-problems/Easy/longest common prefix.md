To solve the "Longest Common Prefix" problem in an array of strings, you can use a straightforward approach that compares characters of the strings one by one. The goal is to find the longest prefix that is common to all strings in the array.

## üìù C++ Solution

Here‚Äôs a C++ solution to find the longest common prefix:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

std::string longestCommonPrefix(const std::vector<std::string>& strs) {
    if (strs.empty()) return ""; // Return empty if the array is empty

    // Start with the first string as the prefix
    std::string prefix = strs[0];

    // Compare the prefix with each string in the array
    for (size_t i = 1; i < strs.size(); i++) {
        // Reduce the prefix until it matches the start of the current string
        while (strs[i].find(prefix) != 0) {
            prefix = prefix.substr(0, prefix.size() - 1); // Shorten the prefix
            if (prefix.empty()) return ""; // Return empty if no common prefix
        }
    }

    return prefix; // Return the longest common prefix
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> strs = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
    std::string commonPrefix = longestCommonPrefix(strs);
    
    std::cout << "Longest common prefix: " << commonPrefix << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## üöÄ Explanation

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps:
1. **Check for Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, return an empty string.
2. **Initialize Prefix**: Start with the first string as the initial prefix.
3. **Iterate Through Strings**: For each subsequent string in the array:
   - **Use a while loop to check if the current string starts with the current prefix.**
   - If it does not, shorten the prefix by removing the last character until a match is found or the prefix becomes empty.
4. **Return Result**: After checking all strings, return the longest common prefix.

### üìä Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the longest string. In the worst case, you may need to compare each character of each string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for the prefix variable.

This solution efficiently finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings by progressively shortening the prefix until it matches all strings.
